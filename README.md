I made this website when I tried to join Gitlab's team.

Unfortunetly I was not accepted, but I learned a lot of cool
stuff while building it.

From this project, other two project have begun:
[CSS Blend Magnify](https://github.com/trickstival/css-blend-magnify) and
[Vue Typing](https://github.com/trickstival/vue-typing)

I hope you like it :p
